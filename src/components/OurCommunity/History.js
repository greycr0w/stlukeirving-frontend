                            <h2>History of Saint Luke Catholic  Church</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>St. Luke’s Catholic Church, in Irving, Texas achieved the status of a parish in 1947.  However, the real beginnings go back more than fifty years before this date.  Early day history of St. Luke Catholic Church began in 1860 with Mass being held in private homes. The mission of St. Luke was established in 1902.</p> 

<p>Upon founding the City of Irving on December 1, 1903, co-founders, J.O. Schulze and Otis Brown donated three town lots for Catholic, Baptist, and Church of Christ Churches, to be erected.  The first church, a white frame building was immediately constructed on the corner between Jefferson Street and Second Street. The dedication of this building was held on April 24, 1904.  The church quickly became overcrowded and in need of repairs.  In the spring of 1928, two lots were purchased at the corner of Iowa (now O’Connor Blvd.) and Fifth Street.  A red brick veneer building was erected with dedication of the second church on June 10, 1928.  The pastor at that time was Reverend Ralph F. Bayard.</p>

<p>In 1947, Bishop Joseph P. Lynch decided the congregation had increased sufficiently to be established as a parish and appointed Reverend John Brady (later Monsignor) as the first resident pastor.  The parishioners with generosity and skill built and furnished a rectory right next to the church.</p> 

<p>Fr. John Untereiner served as a pastor from 1949 to 1952 in the years following World War II when Irving experienced a huge population growth which was reflected in the number of families registered in the parish.  Because of this growth, the church and rectory were sold.  A site for a church, rectory, and school was donated by Mr. and Mrs. Charles P. Schulze, Sr.</p>

<p>Construction on the third church and rectory was begun in August 1953.  A contemporary design was constructed of buff-colored brick with cast-stone and redwood trim.  It was dedicated on May 2, 1954.</p>

<p>Families were now concerned with the religious education and training for their children.  Irving’s first Catholic School for kindergarten through third grade was dedicated on October 23, 1955.  The school was staffed by lay teachers of the parish.  The following year, Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth staffed the school.  A two-story convent was constructed to the east of the school to house the Sisters.</p>

<p>St. Luke’s membership grew tremendously to over 1,400 registered families.  A proposal for the construction of a new church was made and recommended to the Bishop of Dallas.  In 1985, the decision was made to construct a new church on South MacArthur Blvd.  Pastored by Reverend Daniel J. Clayton, the church, designed by Robert S. Allan, featured a wood ceiling nave dominated by a red granite altar and 40-foot roof supported by concrete columns.  Dedication was held on February 14, 1988.  The historical role of St. Luke was recognized on April 10, 1988 by the dedication of a Historical Marker from the State of Texas.</p>

<p>Throughout the past one hundred and forty eight years, St. Luke Catholic Church has been a great institution, nurturing the people in the area spiritually and physically.  With eight Masses celebrated each weekend in English, Portuguese and Spanish, we are a parish that continues to develop and grow.  With God’s help we shall go on and on….</p>
